        <p>
            The following tutorial is based on the equipment we have currently in the laboratory. You can of course build one even if you don't have exactly the same configuration (screws, platform ...) but some crucials points need to be respected if you want to use the GummiArm thanks to the code provided on the <a href="https://github.com/mstoelen/GummiArm" title="Click to go to the github repository">GummiArm Github</a>
